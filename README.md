# AstronomyDomine
My Spacemacs Configurations.

## Install
You can move files in this project to your Emacs path to install configurations.
However, there is still something you need to configure manually.

### cnfonts
If you don't need characters from CJK sets, you can skip this step.
You can execute `M-x cnfonts-edit-profile` to configure the alignment of different characters.
